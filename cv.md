I am an easy learner and for last 7 years I have been a self studied tourist guide and it has been a strong passion of mine since moving to Chile. Due to the pandemic, there is no more tourism. That's why, now I have time and desire to look for a new area of subsistence for my family. I genuinely love logic and algorithms, and consider myself potentially good at Maths as an engineer. I feel confident with my tech background and have a creative skill set. As I like to communicate, exchange with people and colaborate, I can excel in any group and would be an excellent candidate for the tech tasks.

My **Code sample** is from Kata7 of my [CodeWars profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/anlarus)

```javascript
function factorial(n)
{if (n < 0 || n > 12) { throw new RangeError("Error!"); }  
else {let a = 1;
for ( i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  a = a*i;
} return a;
} 
}

//check the value of variable to be inside the range
//if it is outside return "error"
//if it is inside, create new variable a, one of them factore role,
//and start "for" function 
//and count factor from 1 to previous to n number and multiplicate every time
//exit the loop returning the ultimate "inside range" result
```
