        I am 36 and easy learner. For last 7 years I have been a self-studied
        and self-employed tourist guide and travel coordinator. I genuinely love
        logic and algorithms, and consider myself potentially good at Maths as
        an engineer. I feel confident with my tech background and have a
        creative skill set. As I like to communicate, exchange with people and
        colaborate, I can excel in any group and would be an excellent candidate
        for the tech tasks.

        />I am a queer woman, a partner through 13 years and a toddler´s mother.
        Guiding travellers has been a strong passion of mine since moving to
        Chile. Due to the pandemy, there is no more tourism. That’s why, now I
        have time and desire to look for a new area of subsistence for my
        family. My hobbies are stoneware ceramics and aquarelle painting, i
        enjoy creating and teaching what i know to any interested person. Lately
        to improve my English i watch documentary on Curiosity Stream channel
        and to train my Spanish I write analitical articles as a columnist
        interpreting relevant International trade information in Russian for
